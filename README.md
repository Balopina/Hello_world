# Hey People of the web
this is my first repository


Last month I finished a web design course where I learned the basics and now I am studying the "web" at home by myself.
Html, css, javascript/jquery, php, responsive webdesign.. Learning these languages are my main goals for now. 
and I love cereals.

Cheers
